                <p>Katie  has it all figured out hinging on one very minor detail -- hitting it big in the lottery. When she is not researching industry trends or studying you can find her in the kitchen trying some new recipe, on the soccer field, or scaring monsters out of the closet.</p>
                
               <p>She studied both sociology and history at Stony Brook University in New York and following graduation proceeded to work at a direct mail agency whose client base is solely comprised of organizations in the nonprofit sector.</p>
                
                <p>As a Senior Account Executive with 10 years work experience in direct mail she feels incredible privileged to work with exceedingly talented, passionate people both on the client and agency side whose passion is both inspiring and infectious  Though each charitable organization has a variation on “the mission” at the heart of every mission is the <strong>betterment of all </strong> directed most immediately to those most in need – be it access to clean water, research innovative cancer trials / therapies...</p>
                
                <p>A self-described student of life otherwise referred to as glutton for pain in the pursuit of higher learning went to school while working full time and got her CMM from New York University. Currently at it again she is pursuing her certification in Full Stack Web Development from Georgia Tech.</p>
